# Datafest_Competition_best_insights_awards
## This is my presentation for datafest competition in Penn State University. It won the Best insights awards.
### The competition is that every team will be given a 2GB size indeed job posting dataset and then tell audience their discovery.
### My experiment design is about how to find proper job given some basic but practical assumptions.
### I have lost my previous data and projects, therefore I can not recall every detail.
